# ECoG-processing


The ECoG data is an electrode inserted into the lerft audio area and a signal measured by earlobe 

this processing use Synchronizing averaging and add triger (several stimulations)

Data info

- sampling rate: 1000Hz
- Each trial (Measuring by stimulation) consist of 2 sec (-0.3 pre-stimulation and +1.699 post-stimulation)
- remove noise using Synchronizing averaging (ensemble averaging)
- 8 stimulations ('Ears: 1', 'Eyes: 2', 'Throat: 3', 'Nose: 4', 'Sam: 5', 'Oh: 6', 'Gu: 7', 'Ship: 9')

Auditory evoked potential (AEP) according to the stimulus word is obtained and compared
